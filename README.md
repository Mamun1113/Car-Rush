A Three JS project

In Car Rush, player will find himself navigating a track while piloting the main object as a car, through intuitive keyboard controls. The primary objective is to ensure the car’s safe travel by moving it to the left and right directions using the arrow keys.
The goal is to build a visually beautiful and interactive web experience including following features:
• Car Movement: User will be able to interact with car using keyboard arrow keys. Right arrow key is to move right and left arrow key is to move left.
• Car Collision: User accidentally might collide with other object. Collision will result in game over.
• Score: The more a player can pass the road, the more he/she can score.
